# 📎 FAQ

  * 🔶 **How clone this repository ?**
     * ``` git clone https://github.com/0x000cb/otc.git  && cd otc && git submodule update --init --recursive ```
     
   -----------
  
  * ⭕ **PROBLEMS**

     * Everything worked out, but when i inject onetap, menu it does not render.
        * Enable multi-threaded rendering (in csgo) and then inject OTC. 
        * If everything still does not work before, add a flag to disable d3x9 in the CS: GO startup parameters.

     * I inject otc into the game but it freezes and doesn't respond. ```(And also the consumption of processor resources is reduced to 2-3%)```
       * Try to open the console before the injection. The problem most often lies in the injector.
       > p.s This issue is observed on Windows prior to version 10.

     * When you already fix what I need so much ??? I can’t play without it !!! (There should be a function name without which you cannot play)
        * First of all, we try to solve the most important problems. 
        * In TODO, you can see the order in which work is currently being performed.

     * The game crashes when I try inject OTC.
       * Make sure you have the latest version of OTC. 
       * If you inject an addon then try without it, very often it causes crashes.
       * Injector problems are also possible. (Try use process hacker)
       > p.s Injection through crashhandler spoofing can also cause crashes.

  * 📑 **DEVELOPMENT**

     * I found this repository, but can't find OneTap source code.
       * Right. This is just a loader, that initializes & patch & invoke a binary file in game memory. 
       * You can watch/patch file [**here**](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/blob/master/OTC/cpp/segment/Segment.cpp).

     * How update signatures, index's, and netvars?

       * Signatures.
         * Vector: [m_signatures](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/blob/master/OTC/headers/frameworks/SegmentFramework.h#L112) 
         * FAQ: [#12](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/issues/12) 

       * Index's
         * Function: [CustomVirtualCaller](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/blob/master/OTC/cpp/frameworks/SegmentFramework.cpp#L79)
         * You just need to go to unknowncheats, find out which index the rest have shifted from, and how much, and set this as a rule in the method.
         * Example:
             * Shifting base: 179.
             * Shifting count: 2.
             * ```cpp
                if (index >= 179) {
                   index += 2;
                } 

        * Netvars:
          * Vector: [m_netvars](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/blob/master/OTC/headers/frameworks/SegmentFramework.h#L106)
          * Just change the second argument in the structure to the current value. It's all. (Recommend use: hazedumper)

      * How to change the name in the watermark to your own?
         * We need to clone the project with git. To do this, see the first paragraph of the FAQ.
         * Then we need go to: dev -> dllmain.cpp, and edit this lines: https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/blob/master/OTC/dllmain.cpp#L103.
         * Compile and inject. Gl & Hf.
