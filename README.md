# 🔮 OTC Loader  / ![Windows](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/workflows/Windows/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push) /

----------------------------------------------------

Hello. This loader loads and initializes onetap crack in the CS:GO game.

# FAQ
  * How clone this repository?
     * ``` git clone https://github.com/0x000cb/otc.git  && cd otc && git submodule update --init --recursive ```

  * Everything worked out, but when i inject onetap, menu it does not render.
     * Enable multi-threaded rendering (in csgo) and then inject OTC. 
     * If everything still does not work before, add a flag to disable d3x9 in the CS: GO startup parameters.

  * I inject otc into the game but it freezes and doesn't respond. ```(And also the consumption of processor resources is reduced to 2-3%)```
    * Try to open the console before the injection. The problem most often lies in the injector.
    > p.s This issue is observed on Windows prior to version 10.

  * When you already fix what I need so much ??? I can’t play without it !!! (There should be a function name without which you cannot play)
     * First of all, we try to solve the most important problems. 
     * In TODO, you can see the order in which work is currently being performed.

  * The game crashes when I try inject OTC.
     * Make sure you have the latest version of OTC. 
     * If you inject an addon then try without it, very often it causes crashes.
     * Injector problems are also possible. (Try use process hacker)
     > p.s Injection through crashhandler spoofing can also cause crashes.

  * I found this repository, but can't find OneTap source code.
    * Right. This is just a loader, that initializes & patch & invoke a binary file in game memory. 
    * You can watch/patch file [**here**](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/blob/master/OTC/cpp/segment/Segment.cpp).

  * How update signatures, index's, and netvars?

    * Signatures.
       * Vector: [m_signatures](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/blob/master/OTC/headers/frameworks/SegmentFramework.h#L78) 
       * FAQ: [#12](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/issues/12) 

    * Index's
       * Function: [CustomVirtualCaller](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/blob/master/OTC/cpp/frameworks/SegmentFramework.cpp#L86)
       * You just need to go to unknowncheats, find out which index the rest have shifted from, and how much, and set this as a rule in the method.
       * Example:
           I know that indexes since 190 have shifted by 2.
           So I need to do like this: index> 189 index + = 2;
           This will quickly and easily fix indexes.

     * Netvars:
        * Vector: [m_netvars](https://github.com/0x000cb/otc/blob/master/OTC/headers/frameworks/SegmentFramework.h#L72)
        * Just change the second argument in the structure to the current value. It's all. (Recommend use: hazedumper)
